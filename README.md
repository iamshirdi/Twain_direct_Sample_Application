I have developed a sample app using Twain direct protcol(Bridge App) instead of twain commands C# app (self written) hoping my App need not be changed in future when Scanners are directly Twain direct compatible (without Twain bridge). It also supports accesing scanner remotely (lan,cloud- programmatic interface only)

# Twain_direct_Sample_Application
- Twain Direct API Sample Implementation in Pure JS(index,script for easy integration in any programming language), Notebook python (for interactive view of process/steps)
- Please do refer Twain direct website for updated and best explaination
https://www.twaindirect.org/
- Using the bridge we should be able to make any legacy twain scanner to twain direct scanner


# Setup Instructions
- Download Twain Bridge from Releases folder in github link
https://github.com/twain/twain-direct
- Dont forget to Install Data source manager(faciliates interaction between DS-yourscanner and Application-bridge) in C:windows/system32 (if your system is 32 bit) and C:windows/sysow64 (64bit system) if you downloaded 32 bit version
- if its 64 bit version install it in system32
https://github.com/twain/twain-dsm
- The Twain Data Source Manager searches for .ds (your scanner) in C: windows twain32 or twain 64

# Lan Implementation Steps
- Bonjour need to be installed on another lan connected PC if you want to use Lan or mdns supported library for browser discovery
- Twain Direct protocol uses HTTPS in Lan communication for TSL Handshake. So cert generated by bridge must be installed on another Lan PC.

# Lan Browser Issues
- Browser requires CORS to be enabled so need to manually enter within C# of Twain bridge code
- Certificate generated by Twain does not contain subject Alternative name need to be added
- Compile the bridge Application according to instructions in twain direct folder

# Cloud Implementation
- Change Address in app.config and point to your self hosted App
- Example of self hosted app written in nodejs which can be hosted anywhere

https://github.com/twain/twain-cloud-express

# Twain Virtual Scanner
- Twain virtual Scanner download for testing if you dont have twain compatible scanner with you everytime.
